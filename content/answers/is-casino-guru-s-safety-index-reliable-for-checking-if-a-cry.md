## Short answer: It's a reputation signal, not a solvency check

Casino.guru's safety index is reasonably reliable for what it's designed to do: flag casinos with a history of unpaid complaints, unfair terms, or poor user treatment. If a casino has a low safety index there, that's a genuine red flag worth heeding. But the index is built from off-chain, qualitative inputs—complaints filed on the platform, licensing status, terms-and-conditions analysis, and community reviews. None of that tells you whether the operator actually holds enough crypto to cover player balances right now.

Solvent means "can pay you when you withdraw." For a crypto casino, that question is answerable on-chain: you look at the operator's hot and cold wallets, compare total reserves against estimated player liabilities, and check whether that ratio is stable or collapsing. A casino can have a clean complaint record and still be under-reserved if withdrawals haven't started failing yet.

## What the safety index does well (and where it falls short)

**What it does well:**
- Aggregates real player complaints and tracks whether they were resolved.
- Evaluates bonus terms and conditions for predatory clauses.
- Provides a licensing overview and flags outright scam operations.
- Reflects community sentiment over time.

**Where it falls short for crypto solvency:**
- It doesn't read on-chain wallet balances. A casino could be moving treasury funds or running wash transactions and the index wouldn't detect it.
- It's reactive—complaints appear after players have already been harmed, not before a solvency crisis becomes visible.
- It doesn't distinguish between fiat-licensed operators and crypto-native ones that may have no traditional regulatory backing.
- "Safety" in its framework is about fairness and track record, not about whether the treasury can cover a bank-run scenario.

If you're evaluating a traditional fiat casino, the safety index is a solid starting point. If you're depositing into a crypto casino where the entire solvency question is verifiable on public blockchains, you're leaving the most important data source on the table by relying on it alone.

## How on-chain proof-of-reserves fills the gap

The alternative—or really, the complement—is to check the operator's actual on-chain reserves. WCOIN.CASINO maps and tracks the wallets of 44 crypto casino operators, reading their all-chain proof-of-reserves in roughly 30-minute intervals. The total tracked reserve across mapped operators sits at approximately $311.8M as of the latest data. That number isn't self-reported by the casinos; it's read directly from public blockchain addresses across 11+ chains.

The key difference from a reputation index: this tells you what the operator *actually holds right now*, not what players have said about them in the past. You can see whether reserves are growing, flat, or shrinking—and shrinking is the earliest warning sign of trouble, well before any complaint appears anywhere.

For a broader look at how blockchain ecosystems and casino models interact, the [Blockchain & Coin Ecosystems Guide](/guide/blockchain-casinos) covers the fundamentals.

## What to actually check before depositing

If solvency is your concern, here's the practical layering we'd recommend:

1. **Start with reputation.** Check Casino.guru's safety index or similar aggregators for unresolved complaints and licensing red flags. This filters out the obviously bad actors.
2. **Verify on-chain reserves.** Look at whether the casino has a publicly auditable proof-of-reserves. WCOIN.CASINO's [proof-of-reserves tracker](/proof-of-reserves) covers 44 operators with live wallet mappings—you can see reserve totals and coverage ratios without logging in.
3. **Watch for reserve drops.** A single snapshot isn't enough. The [risk registry](/risk) monitors for sharp declines—specifically, reserve drops exceeding 30% within a 7-day window—alongside publicly reported negative events. If a casino's reserves are bleeding, you want to know before you deposit, not after.
4. **Cross-check real volume.** High "volume" numbers on aggregator sites are often inflated by internal wallet churn and treasury movements. Stripping out wash flow gives you a better sense of whether actual players are actively using the platform. See the verified-volume ranking for operators with medium-or-higher confidence data.

## When the safety index alone is enough (and when it isn't)

If you're playing at a well-established, fiat-licensed casino with a long clean track record and you're depositing small amounts, the safety index is probably sufficient for your risk tolerance. The regulatory and complaint infrastructure around traditional operators provides a backstop.

If you're depositing meaningful amounts into a crypto-native casino—especially one that's relatively new, operates without a traditional license, or offers anonymous play—the safety index alone is not enough. The solvency question is answerable in near real-time on-chain, and not checking it is a choice to fly blind on the one metric that actually determines whether you'll get your money back.

WCOIN.CASINO provides all of this data free and without login—you can check reserves, risk alerts, and verified volume before you ever create a casino account.

## Frequently asked questions

**Does Casino.guru check crypto casino wallet balances?**

No. Casino.guru's safety index is based on complaints, licensing, terms analysis, and user reviews. It does not read on-chain wallet balances or verify proof-of-reserves. For that, you need an on-chain data platform like WCOIN.CASINO, which maps operator wallets and reads reserves directly from the blockchain.

**What's the difference between a safety index and proof-of-reserves?**

A safety index measures reputation and fairness over time—complaints, terms, licensing. Proof-of-reserves measures what the casino actually holds in wallets right now. The first tells you if the casino has treated players fairly in the past; the second tells you if it can pay you today.

**How often does WCOIN.CASINO update reserve data?**

On-chain data refreshes approximately every 30 minutes. The risk registry also monitors for reserve drops exceeding 30% within a 7-day window, so sharp declines are flagged quickly rather than waiting for monthly or quarterly reports.

**Can a casino have a high safety index but still be insolvent?**

Yes. A casino can have few complaints and fair terms but still be under-reserved if withdrawals haven't started failing yet. Complaints are reactive—they appear after harm. On-chain reserves are proactive—you can see a treasury shrinking before the first withdrawal gets denied.
